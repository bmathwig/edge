            SQUIRE TRELAWNEY, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars
            about Treasure Island, from the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island, and that
            only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I take up my pen in the year of grace 17__ and go back to the time
            when my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof.
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a
            hand-barrow—a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands
            ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid white. I remember him looking
            round the cove and whistling to himself as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards:
            <blockquote>“Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest—Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”</blockquote>
            in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with
            a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared, called roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it
            was brought to him, he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still looking about him at the cliffs and up
            at our signboard.
